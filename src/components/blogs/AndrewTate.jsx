      <h1>Opinion: Andrew Tate</h1>
      <h3>By: Ashwin Vijayakumar</h3>
      <p>
      If you spend any of your free time on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, 
      you might have stumbled upon a figure named Andrew Tate. Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer 
      that has turned to providing online courses, which according to Tate teach you about wealth 
      creation, improving masculinity, and living life to the fullest. But Andrew Tate is also 
      known for his controversial behavior and statements. His misogynistic comments towards 
      women and his comments about mistreating women are big factors for the hate that he receives. 
      He was born in the U.S, raised in the U.K, and moved to Romania after he was trying to dodge 
      accusations of abuse from women that work in his webcam business that he used to own. 
      He also said that he moved to Romania due to the very lax laws on sexual assault and 
      high rates of corruption. He said in a now deleted YouTube video, "I’m not a rapist, 
      but I like the idea of just being able to do what I want. I like being free."
        <br />
        <br />
        We would assume that surely someone like this will instantly not be respected 
        and be ridiculed and shamed for his behavior and actions, but that does not 
        seem to be the case at all. Many loyal Tate enthusiasts seem to love him for 
        his masculinity and seem to think Tate’s behavior is “alpha male” behavior. 
        People think that Tate is a very good example of how to become an “alpha male” 
        and how to control every aspect of your life, one of them being women. 
        There are also many people who support Tate just for his good tips and 
        takes on men’s confidence and masculinity. I have to admit I do agree 
        that some of the things he says on confidence and masculinity are pretty 
        useful for men who deal with self-esteem issues. But unfortunately, 
        these little truths are what drive a lot of Tate fans to ignore the 
        bad characteristics of Tate.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tate made most of his money from kickboxing and running an online webcam business. 
        But now, he makes his money by selling courses. One of his courses is called Hustlers University, 
        which is an online course that focuses on how to make money effectively and affiliate marketing. 
        The problem is that Hustlers University costs $50 per month and you can learn everything that is 
        being taught in the course for free. The course is also run as a sort of pyramid scheme as people 
        are paid to recruit others and those people are paid to recruit more people and so on. This course 
        preys on desperate men who would do anything to become more “alpha”. 
        <br />
        <br />
        The reason why Tate is super popular and always on people’s TikTok For You page is 
        due to his marketing strategies. His marketing of saying controversial things attracts
        a lot of attention. He basically follows the principle of “All publicity is good publicity, 
        even bad”. This allows Tate to grow his fanbase and customer base, but this also comes at 
        the cost of attracting hate and negative attention.

        My advice to you readers reading this post: Before you decide whether or not you like Andrew Tate, 
        look into him and his points specifically instead of just following the masses. 
        Make your own opinion and judgment. Don’t think like a sheep. Have a mind of your own. 
        Do research and then make a decision. My personal opinion is that I do not like him overall, 
        but if you disagree with my points or see a mistake in my research, please contact me and let me know 
        <br />
        <br />
        Don’t take this too seriously. I’m open to discussion.
