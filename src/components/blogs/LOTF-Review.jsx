      <h1>Lord of the Flies Review</h1>

        Every summer in our school district for middle and high-schoolers, we
        have to do a summer reading project for the upcoming school year. It
        usually involves reading a book and completing an assignment that goes
        along with it. In 8th grade, the summer assignment for my upcoming
        freshman year of high school was to read the 1954 William Golding novel
        Lord of the Flies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now at first, I dreaded reading this book because it seemed very boring
        and a waste of time. As a kid, who would want to spend time reading
        books instead of going outside with friends or playing video games? But
        in mid June I realized that it was best not to procrastinate on the
        assignment and I started to read the Lord of the Flies . In the first
        chapter, I was so confused about what was happening in the book that I
        had to reread the chapter. But after rereading, I had a better idea of
        the setting and what is going on in the abandoned island. My initial
        thoughts were, “Why is Ralph so mean to Piggy?”. It was a bit of a
        stupid thought considering the circumstances of what was happening in
        the book, but I brushed off the matter as some common 1950 British
        schoolboy banter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyways, throughout the book, you see how the boys change from normal,
        civilized boys into barbaric savages. But how does this truly occur? You
        would think, “Oh I would never devolve into these inhuman savages if I
        was on that island.” But would you truly? The point of the book is to
        show you the instinctive human nature of savagery and how without any
        rules or order, this behavior will emerge. I love this book just because
        of how it highlights this concept of civilization versus savagery. The
        book dives deep into the minds of the characters and how they operate.
        We see many instances where Ralph tries to stay civil, but succumbs to
        his inner savagery. After I read the whole book, I had to complete my
        assignment given to me. So just to make sure I comprehended everything
        that happened in the book correctly, I went to a website called
        SparkNotes to get a detailed summary of each chapter so that I can see
        if I missed any important details and to get a better understanding of
        the plot. While I was here, I stumbled upon the Fruedian personality
        theory, which stated that the human psyche has three components, the id,
        the ego, and the superego. The id is the instinctive part of your mind;
        it responds to basic and primitive urges, such as sexual desire,
        aggression, and immediate pleasure. The superego is the moral and
        logical part of your mind; it is basically the opposite of the id and it
        makes sure that you are always doing what is morally right and tells you
        to not succumb to the id’s primitive instincts. The ego takes both the
        id and superego and tries to balance them; it uses reality and considers
        outside factors in order to make the correct decision. This concept I
        realized is used in the novel and highlights all of the three
        components. Jack can be considered as the id, a person who has thrown
        morals and societal norms out the window and only follows his basic
        instincts. Simon can be considered as the superego as he never once in
        the story succumbs to the id desires. But the flaw in the superego is
        that it does not take into the situation occurring around the person.
        This is why Simon unfortunately died. And finally, Ralph can be
        considered as the ego, the balance between primitive instincts and moral
        judgment. Ralph’s character throughout the story shows how he still has
        a sense of order, morality, and logical thought while almost everyone
        has followed in Jack’s footsteps. Ralph’s balance between primal
        instincts and logical judgment kept him alive at the end of the story.
        Although the whole story cannot be explained in terms of id, ego, and
        superego, it really sheds a light on how humans will turn toward primal
        and id behavior if there is no order and societal norms to follow.
        <br />

        Overall, I would highly recommend this book to read as it has a very
        interesting plot and the underlying theme of this story is very complex
        and intricate. So go ahead and buy this book or pirate it, I don’t care.
        Just read it!
