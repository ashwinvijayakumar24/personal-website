        My life as an emerging and aspiring programmer is hard. It was a
        struggle to learn even the fundamentals of programming and there is
        still much more to learn in order to be a good programmer. I only
        started programming in middle school around 6th grade because my parents
        wanted me to. They are both software engineers for big companies and
        they told me that you can earn a lot of money programming. But the thing
        was, my parents didn’t help me learn programming at all. They told me to
        go learn programming by myself as it will help me become more
        independent and develop a good work ethic. I’m pretty sure it was
        because they were lazy, but it doesn’t matter as these things were true
        and independent learning greatly benefited me when doing work. I made a
        lot of poor decisions in finding the best way to learn programming, so I
        am not going to tell you how I learned programming, but rather I am
        going to tell you how you can learn to code for free in a very efficient
        manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        I think a really good way to learn by yourself is to watch youtube
        tutorials and code along with them step-by-step. This is really helpful
        for more visual learners and I prefer learning like this as the people
        in these videos are usually very well taught and cover all the content
        you need to know clearly and provide many examples of core topics. They
        also might walk you through building a project using the programming
        language that you are learning. This is helpful as you can see how
        everything you learned can come together to create a useful product.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can also use free online websites that teach you how to code such as{" "}
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>,{" "}
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>,{" "}
        <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>, and{" "}
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> just to name a few.
        These websites are very well developed and alongside video and
        instructional content, they give you practice in what you are learning
        to make sure that you are understanding the content being provided.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another thing you can do to learn coding for free is signing up for free
        coding bootcamps and lessons. There are many companies and organizations
        that offer free coding and programming courses online. One example is{" "}
        <a href="https://www.codewizdom.org/">Code Wizdom</a>, a company that I
        co-founded with my partner. This way of learning is beneficial as you
        learn with an instructor, meaning that you can ask questions in
        real-time if you do not understand something and it also makes the
        learning interactive.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, I think it is best if you combine these three ways when
        learning a new programming language in order to make sure you are
        thoroughly understanding all of the content.
