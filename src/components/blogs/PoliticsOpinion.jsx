      <h1>Opinion: Politics as a teenager</h1>

        The first time I learned about politics, elections, political parties, 
        and political ideologies was around 4th grade. This was when the 2016 US
         presidential election was going on, primarily between Donald Trump and 
         Hillary Clinton. As an immigrant family originating from India, my family 
         was not really into voting, but we leaned to the democratic side. So naturally, 
         I myself also leaned towards the left. I never thought of politics as a big deal 
         and none of my friends or peers did either. When my elementary school had a mock 
         presidential election, I naturally picked Clinton and when people asked why, 
         I said “Just because”. I then learned much more about political ideologies as 
         the 2020 presidential elections rolled around. I learned about the difference 
         between left and right wing political ideologies, capitalist societies vs. 
         communist and socialist societies, libertarianism vs. authoritarianism, left 
         vs right wing political agendas, popular left and right wing congressmen, 
         media outlets, judges, presidents, and celebrities. It was here that I realized 
         that I wanted to know where on the political spectrum that I fell under. I took 
         this test called the political compass test, which after measuring if you fall 
         left or right on the political spectrum, also measures if you lean to more 
         authoritarian beliefs or more libertarian beliefs. I took the test 3 times, 
         once in 8th grade, once in 9th, and once right before writing this blog. 
         The first 2 times, I leaned slightly towards the left and slightly towards 
         libertarian. But as I grew up and got a better understanding of our economic 
         and civil systems, I realized that I agree with more economic standards 
         of the right such as a freer market and a capitalist system. 
         The third time I took the test, I actually was completely in the 
         center of the political spectrum. I was still leaning libertarian, 
         but I moved more right to where I was in the center. 
         I realized that I lean towards left ideologies in 
         social aspects while leaning towards right ideologies 
         for more economic aspects.

        Now the point of this blog wasn’t to discuss my political beliefs nor to debate
         which side is better, but to talk about how many people of my age group tend 
         to blindly support and follow one side without being truly informed of a side’s 
         ideologies and policies. A big factor of this is the influence of your family, 
         but I personally believe that the bigger factor tends to be the influence of 
         social media. The issue is that people want to fit in with their peers. 
         Psychologically, this makes sense as not fitting in means exclusion from 
         the group and results in less social encounters. But as trends show that 
         young people are leaning towards democratic beliefs, it's easy for kids to 
         automatically label themselves as a democrat. And on the other side, young 
         people who want to stand out from the crowd choose to side towards being a 
         republican by just picking 1 or 2 reasons. Unfortunately, this leads to kids 
         and teens picking a party to support (In my experience, my peers tend to pick 
         democratic) and they stick to it without actually learning about the ideologies 
         behind the parties and what they believe in. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I admit that I was like this before, but I then got more informed about everything 
        and now I realize that I am not as democratic as I thought I was and that I am mostly 
        democratic for social standards while I lean republican for economic standards.
