      <h1>How to Study for AP Human Geography</h1>
      <h3>By: Ashwin Vijayakumar</h3>
      <p>
        Right now, as I am writing this blog post, I am 15 years old and have
        just finished my freshman year of high school. Our school had 2
        available AP courses for freshmen, and naturally, I took both of them as
        I believed that I can handle the intensity and advanced content the
        classes provide. These classes were AP Human Geography and AP Computer
        Science Principles. Now as throughout most of my school years, I have
        always stayed on top of my schoolwork thanks to my parents and my work
        ethic. I studied and understood concepts easily, so I personally didn’t
        have any trouble in my elementary and middle school classes. My
        assumption that AP classes will also not be troublesome was a mistake.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I already had experience with computer science in my past, AP
        Computer Science Principles wasn't that bad, but AP Human Geography was
        the big shocker. I had to digest a lot of content about various sub
        topics such as spatial relationships, population distribution and
        structures, culture, political processes, agriculture, urban land-use,
        economic process, industrialization, and much more. Taking notes in my
        notebook everyday was not enough for me. I personally learn better by
        doing more than just taking notes. I learn more by watching videos,
        doing practice exams and questions, and reading content material
        thoroughly. I got through units 1-4 very easily as most of it was more
        common sense and knowledge and the memorization of terms is easier and
        more minimal in my opinion. I would advise to study units 5-7 the most
        as I struggled with those more.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of my biggest helpers throughout the year was Mr.Sinn, a youtuber
        who makes AP Human Geography topic review videos. He goes in-depth about
        every single chapter in a specific unit and makes learning the content
        easy to understand. He also owns a Discord server in which AP Human
        Geography students can communicate, collaborate, and help each other
        out. This channel really helped me study and cram 2-3 weeks before the
        AP exam and I highly recommend checking this channel out throughout the
        whole school year as you keep on learning new topics. You can gain a new
        insight on these new topics and gain a better understanding of these
        topics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another way I studied was through reading the AMSCO Human Geography
        official textbook I got at the beginning of the year. This method of
        learning is less fun and more time-consuming, but it literally has
        everything you need to know and every single concept, vocabulary
        definition, and topic is covered thoroughly. The book also has multiple
        practice MCQ’s and FRQ’s throughout the book and one big practice exam
        at the end of the book, giving you more practice.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another big resource I used was AP Classroom videos. These videos will
        be available when you enroll in your AP class on the College Board
        website. The videos are taught by AP instructors and are taught in an
        easy-to-understand manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        The last thing I recommend is to do many practice exams. There are many
        online and you can take these practice exams to help you prepare for the
        real exam in May.
        <br />
        <br />
        Combining all of these methods, you can easily pass the AP Exam and
        maybe even receive a 4 or 5!
