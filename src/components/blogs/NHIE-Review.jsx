      <h1>Never Have I Ever: A Mindy Kaling Fantasy</h1>
      <h2>By: Ashwin Vijayakumar</h2>
      <h3>Date: 06/12/23</h3>
      <p>
        I recently watched the final season of the comedy-drama series Never Have I Ever, 
        directed by Mindy Kaling. <strong>Disclaimer: this blog review is mainly for people who have already 
        watched the show. </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Before I talk about my critiques, I'll admit that I did enjoy some of the drama that came with the show. 
        But that was the only somewhat decent thing. The bulk of the major issues of the show stems down to one 
        thing: the show's unrealistic nature. This kills me every single time, which is often. There are loads of 
        examples of this, but let me list a few:
        <ul style={{width:'80%', margin:'auto'}}>
          <li>Devi calling her mom a b*tch (most Indian kids respect their parents enough to not do this)</li>
          <li>Devi sneaking out to go party (again, most Indian kids don't do this)</li>
          <li>Nalini not having a tighter rein on Devi when she becomes intolerant (most parents wouldn't constantly let their kids get into trouble...)</li>
          <li>Devi being obsessed with the need to get laid (COME ON! Even non-Indians aren't that obsessed with getting laid)</li>
          <li>Pati needing a white boyfriend (uhh... most Indian widows, especially over the age of 40 don't remarry)</li>
          </ul>
        <br />
        The pitiful attempts at showing Indian culture throughout the show just shows the lack of knowledge 
        from Mindy Kaling and the writers behind the scenes. A quick example I can point out throughout the 
        show is that other than Nalini every once in a while, no one even speaks Tamil. Even when Nalini speaks 
        to her own mother when visiting India, they speak in English. I get that this is for the audience watching,
        but I believe adding more Tamil dialogue will add to the realism of the show. This just shows that the writers
        seem incompetent in understanding Tamil culture. Again there are many more instances of shoddy attempts to show
        Indian culture.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the biggest problems with this show is how Devi seems to hate her culture completely. 
        Kaling portrays that being Indian is uncool by showing how Devi attempts to get out of Indian functions 
        and trying to break free from Indian "norms." I mean I guess Kaling is embarrassed of herself so much 
        that she has to portray her own fantasy of what she actually wants to be in Devi. Or maybe Mindy is 
        trying to break the stereotype that Indians are nerdy and uncool. But misrepresenting Indian culture 
        is not the way to do so. Realistically, Devi is not empowering teen Indian girls around the world by 
        going around and juggling boyfriends and trying to get laid. I'm sorry but Kaling's version of "cool" 
        doesn't match up with most of us Indians out here. Obviously I'm not saying that Devi should just hole up 
        in her room, study, and be a loser. But I am saying that instead of portraying Devi as a party animal obsessed 
        with getting laid, parties, and boyfriends to the point where she makes stupid decisions, 
        Devi should be portrayed a bit more realistic and as a normal Indian teen.
        <br/>
        <br />
        In addition to this, under all of the drama, Devi is just a narcissistic brat who uses people and 
        takes her anger out on others when things don't go her way. A lot of times I was never really rooting 
        for Devi. She gets jealous for the smallest things and bases her value on how many dudes she can get 
        with (as seen with juggling both Ben and Paxton in the earlier seasons). It's fine to be morally ambiguous,
        but it is another thing to make out your character as a brat who hasn't really learned anything.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another thing that ties along with Kaling's obsession of Indians trying to be with white/non-Indian people. 
        There were sadly only 3 instances in the show where Indians were together.
        <br />
        <ol style={{width:'80%', margin:'auto'}}>
          <li>Nalini and Mohan (doesn't really even count)</li>
          <li>Kamala and Manish (one of the most realistic things)</li>
          <li>Devi and Des (seemed like a forced addition to the show)</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        Even in other Mindy Kaling shows, the main Indian character tends to fall for these "cool" white dudes. 
        For example, that weird Scooby-Doo remake with Velma being Indian and crushing on the hot white boy Fred, 
        or the Mindy Project, where Mindy is IN LOVE with white men.
        <br />
        <br />
        But all in all, the worst critiques of this show were that it was too unrealistic in the way that Kaling 
        misrepresented Indian culture and how Indian-American teens actually act and the fact that Devi is a 
        horrible representation of how Indian girls are supposed to be and how Devi is supposed to be a source of 
        pride and empowerment to Indian girls.
